## Notes about Image used by ACT

ACT try to use the image as that used in the yaml, the -P option create a mapping between the imagename in the github action yaml and a real image.
Real image will be pulled or get from local registry.
Real image is forced to be get from local registry if --pull=false option is used. This avoid to contact sur of the image and get from the local pulled one. This otpion speed-up a lot local testing and net traffic.
